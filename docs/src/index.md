## Brief Explanation

[Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) are a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. They split the data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents a predicted outcome.

[Random Forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) improve on Decision Trees by creating an ensemble of multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data. The final prediction is made by averaging the outputs of all trees (for regression) or using a majority vote (for classification), which helps reduce overfitting and improves model accuracy.
